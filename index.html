    <p>Grace Hopper (1906-1992) was a United States Navy rear admiral, mathematician, and computer scientist. She is a pioneer of computer programming and was the first to devise the theory of machine-independent programming languages. She used that theory to develop the FLOW-MATIC and COBOL programming languages. </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Created the first programming language compiler.</li>
      <li>Introduced the theory of machine-independent programming that led to the creation of programming languages such as COBOL.</li>
      <li>Was one of the first female officers to achieve the real admiral rank in the U.S Navy.</li>
